# README

This repository provides a preprocessing pipeline for the IXI dataset, tailored for volumetric super-resolution tasks. It uses affine and B-spline registration methods combined with N4 bias field correction, all built on SimpleITK. 

## Features
• Affine + B-spline alignment  
• N4 bias correction  
• Easy integration with SimpleITK workflows  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required Python dependencies  
3. Run the scripts to process IXI volumes
